## Game Development Meetup (GDM)

Anyone interested in game development is welcome to join.

Of course, nationality does not matter. We aim to create a gathering where people from all over the world can come together.

As for the content, we haven't set anything specific, so we hope it can be used as a free forum for exchanging ideas about game development.

Every other Sunday 21:00～22:00 (Japan Time)
